# Maze Solver Project

This project implements a sophisticated maze-solving algorithm for a micromouse. Utilizing the flood fill algorithm, it allows the maze-solving obstacle avoidance bot to efficiently navigate and solve mazes by determining the optimal path without needing to traverse all cells on the map. It can determine the optimal path in a single run, enabling the bot to complete the fast run quickly.

## Key Features

- **Versatility**: Capable of running on a variety of unseen maps.
- **Efficiency**: Overcomes limitations of the LSRB and RSRB algorithms.
- **Complete Algorithm**: The algorithm will always find the path from the start to the goal if such a path exists.
- **Optimization**: More efficient than Depth-First Search (DFS) and A* algorithms for unseen mazes.

This implementation ensures efficient and effective maze-solving capabilities suitable for various applications.
